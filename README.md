# notesapp.com

The NotesApp Frontend enables standard CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete for managing notes. Developed with React.js and styled using TailwindCSS, it offers a responsive and interactive user interface. Written in TypeScript, the application benefits from enhanced type safety and maintainability. It follows a structured, scalable architecture to support future growth. Additionally, the application is Dockerized for streamlined deployment and version control.

## Application directory architecture:

- notesapp.com
  - src (Main source directory for the frontend application.)
  - assets (Contains static files like images, icons.)
  - components (Reusable UI components such as buttons, modals, inputs, etc., used across multiple pages)
  - config (Stores configuration files like API endpoints, environment settings, and constants.)
  - interfaces (TypeScript interfaces and type definitions to ensure type safety across the application)
  - layouts (Defines layout wrappers (e.g., header, sidebar, footer) used to maintain consistent structure across pages.)
  - pages (Holds the main route-based React components representing different views/screens of the app.)
  - routes (Manages application routing logic, maps paths to specific components or views.)
  - services (Handles API calls and business logic for interacting with backend endpoints.)
  - utilities (Helper functions and utility methods used throughout the application for common tasks.)
- Dockerfile (Defines instructions for building the Docker image of the frontend application.)
- docker-compose.yaml (Manages multi-container Docker applications)
- run.sh (Shell script to start the Docker container for the application.)
- down.sh (Shell script to stop and remove Docker containers and related resources.)
- format.sh (Shell script for formatting code using tools like Prettier or ESLint.)
